## Emergency? {.unnumbered}

What if my situation changes (for any reason) during the semester?

If you need to miss a session, just review the materials (including the class recording, if available) and move on, and please feel encouraged to ask for help.

If an emergency arises that will keep you from timely completion of an assignment, send an email to us saying the following:

> I have an emergency that will keep me from completing (*list things you're worried about completing*) in a timely fashion. I will contact you again when I am able to make plans.

- We will respond with "OK" and temporarily excuse you from things until **you** send a "re-connection" email to make plans for making up the work you missed, at which time he'll evaluate the situation and together you can make that plan. At no time do you owe us any information about your health or the nature of the emergency.
